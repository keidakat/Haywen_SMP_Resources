1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,400
If you're going to hear the truth, what you are, and what I am, we never told the truth

2
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,280
for ten minutes in this house.

3
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,620
Well hear this, Willie.

4
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,680
This is me.

5
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,720
You want to know why I had no address for three months?

6
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:46,200
It's because I stole a suit in Kansas City and I was in jail.

7
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,640
I stole myself out of every good job since high school and I never got anywhere because

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,340
you blew me so full of hot air.

9
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,340
I can never stand taking orders from anybody.

10
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,340
That's whose fault it is.

11
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:08,460
It's goddamn time you heard that, Pop.

12
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,820
I ran down eleven flights with a pen in my hand today.

13
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,820
Suddenly I stopped.

14
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,820
You hear me?

15
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:23,180
And in the middle of that office building, do you hear this?

16
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:33,700
I stopped in the middle of the building and I saw the sky.

17
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:40,180
You know, I saw all the things that I love in this world, just the work and the food,

18
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,180
time to just sit and smoke.

19
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:52,460
I looked at the pen and I thought to myself, what the hell am I grabbing this for, huh?

20
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,100
Why am I trying to become what I don't want to be?

21
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:03,540
What am I doing in an office making a contemptuous begging fool of myself when all that I want

22
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,420
is out there waiting for me the second I say I know who I am?

23
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,420
Why can't I say that, Willie?

24
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,620
Pop, look at me.

25
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,340
I'm a dime a dozen and so are you.

26
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:23,100
I'm not a leader of men, Willie, and neither are you.

27
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,580
You were never anything but a hard-working drummer who landed in the ash can like all

28
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:34,140
the rest of them and me, I'm a dollar an hour, Willie.

29
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,980
I tried seven states.

30
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,660
I couldn't raise it.

31
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,900
One buck an hour.

32
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,680
Do you gather my meaning, huh?

33
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:57,640
I'm not bringing home prizes anymore and you gotta stop waiting for me to bring them

34
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,640
home, Pop.

35
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm nothing.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,120
I'm just what I am, that's all.

37
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:24,440
Thank you.
