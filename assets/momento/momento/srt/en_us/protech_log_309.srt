00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Log 309. Project Black Ice has finally been put into the construction phase.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,040
Due to the nature of this project, this log is to be kept in the possession of only researchers

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,960
of the Phalanx Division and Level 6 security clearance. The project is set up to function

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,160
within the coming month. The predicted time of operation should be ready for use within a week

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:29,120
after functionality. The CEO of ProTech and the Board of Directory has no clue about this project

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,200
as they would never agree to the use of lethal force to fix our current issue

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,840
with our Grand Goddess. She is out of control and killing innocents,

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:45,760
so we are taking matters into our own hands. Last test run of Project Horizon was very successful

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,760
as we have our god in containment and secured down with Horizon.

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,960
We will continue with the test run of Project Black Ice soon.
