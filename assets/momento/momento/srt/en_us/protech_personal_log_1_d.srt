00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
Personal log one, HR seems to think recording my life through these logs will help me get

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,360
rid of my quote-on-quote stressful and loose-canon-like attitude. Whatever.

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,440
Recently life has been pretty boring for me here at ProTech Industries, though something

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,040
interesting has happened today. An anomaly was found on radars earlier in the day,

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,840
and me and some of my team were sent out to see if any tech was involved as well as

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,360
do any maintenance on any of the protogens out in the field that may take damage while out there.

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,400
This is going to be interesting to say the least.
