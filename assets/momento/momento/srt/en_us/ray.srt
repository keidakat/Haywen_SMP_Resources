00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
This is one of the funniest things I've seen all week.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,000
So this looks like any normal police conference in Florida.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,300
But notice the sign language interpreter here.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,600
So apparently this woman just walked into the police station and was like,

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,900
I'm a sign interpreter. You should hire me.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,900
And they did.

7
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,400
But here's the crazy part.

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,300
She's not.

9
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,400
So there she is on live TV just making shit up.

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,300
Just bullshit hand movements all over the place.

11
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,900
Just fake it till you make it.

12
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,100
And even though the cops were right there, they couldn't arrest her.

13
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,000
Because technically it's not a crime to lie on your resume.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,400
I just didn't ask enough questions.
